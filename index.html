    <p>
    If we have HIV our immune system are weak. Then it is easy to get other infections. These are called
    opportunist infections. STI, pneumonia and TB are examples of opportunistic infection.Human immunodeficiency virus
    is an infection that attacks the body's immune system. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the most advanced stage
    of the disease. HIV targets the body's white blood cells, weakening the immune system.
